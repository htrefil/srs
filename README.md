# srs
A Cube 2: Sauerbraten server reimplementation, not based on existing Sauerbraten source code. Currently work in progress.

## What is done
- Protocol data (de)serialization
- Config (at least the very base of it)

## What is to be done
Everything. At it's current state, the server does nothing at all, only accepts connections.
